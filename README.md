### Template Credits

This site uses the **Massively** theme by HTML5 UP, a free, open-source template provider:

> *Massively* is a text-heavy, article-oriented design built around a huge background image and scroll effects. It’s a slight departure from one-pagers, built using parallax and Scrollex-powered scroll effects.
